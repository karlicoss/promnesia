 This whole time I've been trying to keep myself up, when you're really supposed to be preventing the fall.  This exercise gets you to use the strongest muscles in this exercise (shoulders) to prevent your torso falling down. Whereas I think previously I, and a lot of people, would be trying to balance the body mostly with the hands, and the position of the legs, if that makes sense.

 Anyway, hope it helps someone.

 I've enjoyed [Chandler Carruth's _There Are No Zero-cost Abstractions_](
