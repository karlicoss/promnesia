   * maybe icons for mobile/desktop?

   * use some python lib to extract normalized urls? there must be something.. however normalization has to be simple enough, so JS site could use it too.
* better regex fox url extraction
 eh, urls can have commas...  e.g. http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html
 so, for csv need a separate extractor.
* STRT [#B] describe why and what for each permission used
