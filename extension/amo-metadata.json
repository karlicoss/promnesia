You can find up-to-date extension code here https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/tree/master/extension

The build instructions assume that the zip file with source code is in =/path/to/promnesia-source.zip= (on the HOST system).
*Make sure to replace it with the actual path to the source code zip file.*

To build you need *Ubuntu 24.04/Noble* and *Node 20*. The easiest way to build cleanly would be a Docker container:

```
# on the HOST system: cleanup previous container -- if it didn't exist in the first, it will show an error, ignore it
docker rm -f promnesia_build

# on the HOST system: create the container
docker create --name promnesia_build -it ubuntu:noble /bin/bash

# on the HOST system: put the sources into the container
docker cp /path/to/promnesia-source.zip promnesia_build:/promnesia.zip

# on the HOST system: start the container
docker start -i promnesia_build
```

After that build the addon (run these commands INSIDE the container if you choose to do it with Docker):

```
$ apt update && apt install -y git curl unzip
$ curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -
$ DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y nodejs
$ unzip promnesia.zip -d promnesia
$ cd promnesia
$ npm install
$ ./build --firefox --release --lint --publish=skip
```


The final artifact will be in =/promnesia/dist/artifacts/firefox/promnesia-<version>.zip= (INSIDE the container).

If you need to get it back onto the HOST system (e.g. to test in the browser), run on the HOST system (e.g. in a separate terminal):

docker cp promnesia_build:/promnesia/dist/artifacts/firefox/promnesia-<version>.zip .

This will copy it into the current directory on the HOST system.
