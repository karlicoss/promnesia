* =v1.0.20210415=

Thanks @ankostis, @seanbreckenridge, @gms8994, @Cobertos and others for changes!

** general
- *deprecate*: if you have =import promnesia= in the config you should switch it to =import promnesia.common=
   
    see https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/pull/225
    This brings us closer towards making promnesia a namespaced package to allow for better extensibility.
- better Windows support https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/pull/197

** indexer
- *new*: 'update' style indexing is now the default https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/pull/211

  It means that database won't be emptied before reindexing, so if you only index a single datasource, the data for other datasources will be untouched.
  If you want the previous behaviour, you can use =--overwrite=
- fixes for race conditions during 'update' style indexing https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/pull/220
- minor cannon enhancements
