I'm in the process of putting up better developer's documentation, but you should be able to figure it out from the CI pipelines:

- [[file:../.github/workflows/main.yml][Github Actions]]
- [[file:../.circleci/config.yml][CircleCI]].

* Run backend
   During development, the easiest way to run =promnesia= as =scripts/promnesia=. Alternatively, you can use =pip install -e .=.

   # TODO reuse doc from pymplate?

* Build extension

   : cd extension
   : ./build --firefox # you can also use --chrome
   :         --lint    # [optional], run webext linter
   :         --release # [optional], build in the release mode (with optimizations)
   :         --publish # [optional], release to the Chrome Web Store/Mozilla addons

   You'll find the result in =dist/=. After that, you can load it in your browser and develop.
   For firefox, note that mozilla intentionally complicates this in several ways. On android, only firefox nightly will let you install arbitrary extensions. On desktop, you have a choice between running nightly, re-installing your unpacked extension after every firefox restart, or setting up signing through web-ext. For a quick start into the extension development, on desktop, chrome is therefore recommended (and is the author's primary browser, i believe?). On mobile, firefox nightly is your only option (?).

* Run end-to-end tests

   You need:

   - firefox dev edition (standard wouldn't let you install unsigned extensions) and =geckodriver=
   - TODO chromedriver?
   - =pip3 install pyautogui= for keyboard automation

   Example of running a test:

   : PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m pytest -s 'tests/end2end_test.py::test_add_to_blacklist[chrome]'
