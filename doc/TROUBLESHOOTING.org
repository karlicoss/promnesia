Here I'm going to keep some sort of FAQ updated as people encounter common issues.

In the meantime:

- your browsing history may contain *sensitive data*. If you're posting or sending me error logs *make sure you strip away all private information* (ideally only attach the relevant bits of the log, containing errors)
- make sure you [[file:../README.org::#install][installed promnesia]] properly, and [[file:SOURCES.org][extra dependencies]], if necessary
- make sure [[file:../README.org::#try-it-out][demo]] works as expected

  It doesn't require any extra setup and dependencies, so if this doesn't work it's a good sign something is broken.
  If necessary, run it on a different port (e.g. =--port 15555=) and choose the same port in the extension settings in your browser.

- check your config: =promnesia config check=
- if you have issues with HPI (=my.= modules, etc), follow [[https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/master/doc/SETUP.org#troubleshooting][HPI: troubleshooting]] guide
- run =promnesia index= in your terminal, and pay attention to the error messages and warnings
- run =promnesia serve= in your terminal (on a different port if necessary). Similarly, pay attention to the errors.
- in your browser: try [[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tut_debugging][opening the debugger]] and checking for the errors in the extension logs
