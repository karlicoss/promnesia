*TLDR* : Promnesia isn't collecting any data and isn't transmitting your data to any external site. Not telemetry is collected or sent either.

* How Promnesia works
See [[file:../README.org#how-does-it-work]["How does it work"]] for the longer explanation, but in summary:

- promnesia indexer runs against the files on your computer, and stores the results in the intermediate database (also on your computer)
- promnesia server runs on your computer and exposes a local port (=13131= by default), so it can communicate with the browser extension
- promnesia extension runs in your browser and requests various data from the promnesia server

*By default this all happens only within your system*. The extension works in local-first/offline mode, which is one of the main goals.
(However, if you want, you can set it up on an external domain, with the reverse proxy or something like that).

* What data is requested from the promnesia server

There are just a few requests to the Promnesia server the extension is doing at the moment.

- ~search/search_around~: sends whatever you typed in the search box
- ~visits~: sends the current tab URL to the server (unless it's excluded)
- ~visited~: sends all URLs on the current page to the server (except the excluded ones)

None of the information above is kept by the server, it *only reads the data from the database*.
It is however possible that some of it is retained in the console logs, that would depend on how exactly you're running the server and the log retention policy of your system.

# for fuck's sake, github doesn't support file:GUIDE.org::#excludelist link...
# so it's either broken in emacs or in org-mode. fucking hell
For the maximum privacy you can use the [[file:GUIDE.org#excludelist][excludelist]] feature, this will prevent Promnesia from processing the page/domain.

# TODO if you want to backup your browser history and feed in promnesia (e.g. to overcome the 90 days limit etc)

** External requests

- if you have [[file:GUIDE.org#excludelist][external excludelists URLs]] in the extension settings, they will be updated now and then

  These excludelists are downloaded and cached locally, so no information about when and what you're browsing gets out.


* Extension permissions
- =activeTab=: getting current tab info and adding the sidebar
- =webNavigation=: watching page state changes (to trigger the extension on page load)
- =storage=: for settings
- =contextMenus=: context menu
- =notifications=: showing notifications

There permissions are required at the moment, but there is an [[https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/issues/97][issue]] for work on possibly making them optional.

- =tabs=: making the extension work without an explicit user action (the extension is meant to be a passive assistant)

  The extension is still useful even with explicit action only, so worth making opt-in.
- =history=: to use local browsing history

  Local history isn't strictly required, so we could omit this if people prefer.
- =bookmarks=: used as one of the sources

  It can already be toggled in the settings, so the permission could be dynamic too
- =file/http/https=: the extension is meant to work on any page, hence such a broad scope.

  Might be optional in the future, and requested on demand if people feel it's worth it

* Security
While I have some reasonable understanding of security, I'm no expert, so would be very grateful if you flag potential issues or [[https://github.com/karlicoss/promnesia/issues/14][go through the code]] (especially extension).

There is some ongoing work on Dockerizing: [[promnesia][issues/55]].
